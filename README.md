## Introduction

This repository contains a variety of machine learning algorithms and applications implemented in Python. The goal is to provide educational resources for understanding and applying machine learning techniques. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced practitioner, you will find useful examples and templates to enhance your knowledge and skills.

Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to learn from data. It has numerous applications, including predictive modeling, data analysis, and pattern recognition. This repository covers a wide range of algorithms, from basic models to advanced techniques, to help you grasp the fundamental concepts and apply them to real-world problems.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the code in this repository, you will need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you will need the following Python libraries:

- **NumPy**: A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and many mathematical functions.
- **Pandas**: A powerful, flexible data manipulation and analysis library. It offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.
- **Scikit-learn**: A robust library for machine learning in Python. It includes simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- **Seaborn**: A statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thatritikpatel/python-and-machine-learning-basics.git
cd python-machine-learning
```

Install the required libraries by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will ensure that all necessary dependencies are installed.

## Implemented Algorithms

### Supervised Learning

1. **Linear Regression**:
   - A simple linear approach to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
   - Example: Predicting house prices based on features like area, number of rooms, etc.
   - [Linear Regression Notebook](notebooks/supervised/linear_regression.ipynb)

2. **Logistic Regression**:
   - A classification algorithm used to predict binary outcomes.
   - Example: Predicting whether a given email is spam or not.
   - [Logistic Regression Notebook](notebooks/supervised/logistic_regression.ipynb)

3. **Decision Trees**:
   - A non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression.
   - Example: Classifying whether a loan applicant is likely to default.
   - [Decision Trees Notebook](notebooks/supervised/decision_tree.ipynb)

4. **Random Forest**:
   - An ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees.
   - Example: Improving the accuracy of predictions in credit scoring.
   - [Random Forest Notebook](notebooks/supervised/random_forest.ipynb)

5. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**:
   - A powerful classification algorithm that finds the hyperplane that best separates the classes.
   - Example: Handwritten digit classification.
   - [SVM Notebook](notebooks/supervised/svm.ipynb)

### Unsupervised Learning

1. **K-Means Clustering**:
   - A clustering algorithm that partitions the data into K distinct clusters.
   - Example: Customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior.
   - [K-Means Clustering Notebook](notebooks/unsupervised/kmeans_clustering.ipynb)

2. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**:
   - A dimensionality reduction technique that transforms the data into a new coordinate system.
   - Example: Reducing the number of features in a dataset while retaining variance.
   - [PCA Notebook](notebooks/unsupervised/pca.ipynb)

## Usage

To run the Jupyter notebooks, navigate to the `notebooks` directory and start Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open the notebook you are interested in and follow the instructions provided in the cells. Each notebook contains detailed explanations and code cells that demonstrate the implementation and application of the respective algorithm.

To run the Python scripts, navigate to the `scripts` directory and execute the desired script:

```bash
python supervised/linear_regression.py
```

Each script is designed to be run independently and includes comments and explanations to help you understand the code.

## Results and Evaluation

Each notebook and script includes sections for evaluating the performance of the implemented algorithms. Common evaluation metrics used include:

- **Accuracy**: The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances. It is a straightforward measure of how often the model is correct.
- **Precision and Recall**: Precision measures the accuracy of the positive predictions, while recall measures the proportion of actual positives correctly identified. These metrics are particularly useful for imbalanced datasets.
- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two. It is useful when you need a single metric to evaluate the model's performance.
- **Confusion Matrix**: A table used to describe the performance of a classification algorithm by displaying the true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. It provides a detailed breakdown of the model's performance.

Visualizations such as plots and graphs are also included to help interpret the results. For example:

- **ROC Curve**: A plot that illustrates the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier system. It shows the trade-off between sensitivity (recall) and specificity.
- **Precision-Recall Curve**: A plot that shows the trade-off between precision and recall for different threshold settings. It is particularly useful for imbalanced datasets.
- **Learning Curves**: Graphs that show the training and validation loss/accuracy over epochs, helping to identify if the model is overfitting or underfitting.

## Best Practices

Here are some best practices to keep in mind while working with machine learning projects:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Ensure your data is clean and well-prepared. Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and standardize/normalize the features as needed.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create meaningful features that can help improve model performance. Consider domain knowledge and experiment with different transformations.
- **Model Evaluation**: Use appropriate evaluation metrics and cross-validation to assess the model's performance. Avoid relying on a single metric or a single train-test split.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiment with different hyperparameters to find the best configuration for your model. Use techniques like grid search or random search.
- **Documentation and Comments**: Document your code and add comments to explain the logic and purpose of different sections. This makes it easier for others (and yourself) to understand and maintain the code.
